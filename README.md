The drawing below gives an idea of how to cut a given "true" rectangle into squares ("true" rectangle meaning that the two dimensions are different).

-----------------------------
|           |               |
|           |     4=2^2     |
|           |               |
|   9=3^2   |----------------
|           |       |       |
|           |   1   |   1   |
|           |       |       |
-----------------------------

[sqInRect(5,3) ^^^^^^]



Can you translate this drawing into an algorithm?

You will be given two dimensions
1. a positive integer length (parameter named lng)
2. a positive integer width (parameter named wdth)
